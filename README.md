# signal-pattern

!Circuit diagram is currently under revision!

This code can be used to initiate an alarm via active buzzer by flexing your 
muscle on which electrodes are attached to in a specific order. 
Initially, it requires you to press three times with one or two seconds
between each signal spike received by the EMG. The code will be modified in the
future, so that a unique pattern can be made by simply using a record 
function.

This project was created during the Jugend Hackt 2021 in Berlin. It tries
to help immobile seniors to initiate a call for help during the night by 
flexing their forearm muscles.

The code and the circuit diagram were both developed by Fardin Rezayee
and Hüseyincan Furkan Özkan. For questions please contact us via e-mail.
