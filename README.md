# signal-pattern
This code can be used to initiate an alarm via active buzzer by pressing on
the button in a specific order. The original version requires you to press three
times with one to two seconds in between each pressing. The project will be 
modified in the future, in order to receive the signal via EMG sensor and 
electrodes and output information via a wifi chip.

This project was created during the Jugend Hackt 2021 in Berlin. It tries
to help immobile seniors to initiate a call for help via flexing their
forearm muscles.

The code and the circuit diagram were both developed by Fardin Rezayee
and Hüseyincan Furkan Özkan. For questions please contact us e-mail.
